### Problem
Pricing decisions relied on manual spreadsheets, producing volatile margins and limiting the ability to react to competitive changes.

### Solution
- Defined the pricing hypotheses, guardrails, and success metrics with product and finance.
- Built demand elasticity models in Python with dbt powered feature pipelines feeding Superset dashboards.
- Ran controlled experiments to validate the models before automating weekly recommendations.

### Outcome
- Revenue teams received trusted forecasts and recommendations via scheduled reporting and ThoughtSpot search.
- Marketing and product aligned on a prioritised experimentation roadmap with quantified impact.
- Leadership gained forward looking visibility for planning hiring, supply, and promotional spend.
