### Problem
Disparate GA4 setups, consent tools, and agencies created data loss and conflicting revenue numbers for leadership.

### Solution
- Conducted a multi brand audit covering GA4 schemas, ecommerce events, and CMP integrations
- Rebuilt measurement plans, implemented enhanced ecommerce tagging, and automated validation with server side tests
- Partnered with marketing to embed governance rituals and roll out executive ready dashboards

### Outcome
- Trustworthy acquisition and merchandising reporting within one source of truth
- Faster go to market for seasonal campaigns backed by pre launch QA checklists
- Internal teams confident managing instrumentation without constant contractor support
