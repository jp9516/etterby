title: "Fraud Detection Uplift — EU Classifieds"
client: "Marketplace (EU)"
highlights:
  - Earlier detection of bad actors at operating precision
  - Reduced analyst workload via targeted reviews
  - Hardened pipelines with alerts & SLAs
---

### Problem
Large volumes of short‑lived accounts made manual review ineffective. Losses and user trust were at risk.

### Solution
- Data pipeline overhaul (dbt + Airflow + ClickHouse) to unify signals
- Model development with clear thresholds and business-aligned metrics
- Shadow evaluation and gradual rollout to de‑risk change

### Outcome
- Significant improvement in recall at the target precision
- ~40 days earlier average detection of bad actors
- Weekly exec reporting and clear SLOs for pipeline health
