### Problem
Large volumes of short-lived accounts made manual review ineffective. Losses and user trust were at risk.

### Solution
- Data pipeline overhaul (dbt + Airflow + ClickHouse) to unify signals
- Model development with clear thresholds and business-aligned metrics
- Shadow evaluation and gradual rollout to de-risk change

### Outcome
- Significant improvement in recall at the target precision
- ~40 days earlier average detection of bad actors
- Weekly exec reporting and clear SLOs for pipeline health
