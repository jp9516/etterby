### Problem
Operators were overwhelmed by ad hoc spreadsheets and slow dashboards, making it difficult to spot underperforming stores and campaign ROI.

### Solution
- Interviewed franchisees, marketing, and operations leaders to map critical decisions and reporting rituals
- Rebuilt KPI definitions in dbt and tuned ThoughtSpot/Power BI models for sub second exploration
- Designed story driven dashboards with usage telemetry, certification workflows, and enablement programmes

### Outcome
- Weekly franchise reviews anchored on consistent dashboards and alerts
- Reduced analyst support tickets as owners self served diagnostics and exported recommendations
- Ongoing roadmap owned by internal teams with the founder advising on quarterly enhancements
