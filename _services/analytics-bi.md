**Where we start**
- Map critical decisions, data sources, and the definitions that are currently disputed
- Design a governed semantic layer or ThoughtSpot/BI model that reflects how teams operate
- Prioritise the dashboards, alerts, and self-serve journeys that matter for revenue and operations

**Outcomes**
- Metric definitions aligned across finance, product, and operations with clear ownership
- Dashboards and search-driven analytics that load quickly and answer follow-up questions
- Training cadences that drive adoption and lower reliance on ad-hoc requests

**Stack**
ThoughtSpot, Superset, dbt metrics, Power BI, Hex
