title: "From heuristics to ML"
---

### Context
Marketplaces and regulated gaming operators asked Etterby Analytics to modernise rule based fraud controls without risking good customers. Years of heuristics built by operations teams could not scale with attack volumes. The consultancy rebuilt the controls as Python services and ran them alongside the legacy approach to understand gaps.

### Practice
- Shadow test the machine learning service until precision and recall meet the thresholds agreed with finance, compliance, and trust & safety leaders.
- Document retraining cadences, rollback paths, and audit trails so regulators and stakeholders can see how decisions are made.
- Involve frontline reviewers in feature design and override policies, mirroring the collaboration established at The Stars Group and Grosvenor Casinos.

### Takeaways
- Quiet launches expose blind spots early and build confidence before deprecating heuristics.
- Governance, change management, and training are the differentiators that kept fraud programmes for the global dating marketplace and online gambling brands on target.
- The same playbook supports experimentation platforms and pricing models across distributed Vita Mojo teams.
