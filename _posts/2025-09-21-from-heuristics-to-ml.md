title: "From heuristics to ML"

Shadow evaluation, thresholds, and change management that sticks.

When marketplaces asked for machine learning to replace the heuristics their operations teams had curated for years, I pushed for quiet launches first. We rebuilt the checks as Python services, ran them alongside the legacy rules, and compared every alert. That shadow period exposed blind spots without taking unnecessary risks.

Only once precision and recall cleared the thresholds agreed with finance and compliance did we talk about full go live. Documentation, retraining cadences, and rollback paths were written before we made the switch. Those controls are the reason the fraud programmes I led at Xcelirate and The Stars Group hit targets without disrupting good customers.

Technology is the easy part. The harder work is showing frontline teams how their expertise shaped the model and giving them avenues to override with reason. Working sessions, release notes, and a cadence for feedback help the change land. The same playbook translated to deploying experimentation platforms and pricing models across distributed Vita Mojo teams.
