title: "Outcome-first analytics"
---

Prioritise decisions and measurable change over tooling debates. A simple playbook that aligns data work to outcomes.

Every engagement starts with the same exercise I run with founders at Xcelirate and restaurant leaders at Vita Mojo. We list the commercial metrics that matter this quarter, the operational guardrails that cannot move, and the people accountable for each. That clarity stops scope creep before it starts and keeps analysts from chasing dashboard vanity projects.

From there I map the smallest analytical delivery that creates feedback. At Xcelirate that meant instrumenting fraud funnels and forecasting the exposure in cash terms. At Vita Mojo it was an executive scorecard that made adoption progress visible week by week. Each increment has an owner, a baseline, and a plan to iterate if the first release only gets us part way.

The last layer is enablement so teams can continue without me. Shadowing sessions, playbooks, and simple governance tables make sure context is shared and decisions are reproducible. It is the same approach that helped ThoughtSpot adoption stick with enterprise brands and kept finance, product, and operations aligned around the same numbers.
