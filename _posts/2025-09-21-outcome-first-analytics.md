title: "Outcome first analytics"

### Context
Prioritise decisions and measurable change over tooling debates. Etterby Analytics anchors every engagement around the commercial metrics that matter this quarter, the guardrails that cannot move, and the accountable owners. That clarity stops scope creep before it starts and keeps analysts from chasing dashboard vanity projects.

### Practice
- Map the smallest analytical delivery that creates feedback: fraud funnel instrumentation and cash exposure forecasting for the global marketplace, or executive scorecards to guide Vita Mojo’s product adoption.
- Set baselines, owners, and iteration plans for each increment so progress is visible week by week.
- Pair delivery with enablement—shadowing sessions, playbooks, and governance tables—so internal teams can reproduce results without external dependency.

### Takeaways
- Framing analytics work around decisions aligns finance, product, and operations without endless steering meetings.
- Enablement and governance keep improvements alive after the consultancy exits, a lesson reinforced across marketplaces, restaurant groups, and online gaming operators.
