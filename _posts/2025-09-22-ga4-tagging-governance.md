title: "Making GA4 tagging dependable"
---

### Context
The GA4 rush left many teams with brittle instrumentation and consent gaps. Fixing it starts with ownership. Etterby Analytics partnered with a private equity portfolio to stabilise tagging across five brands and align marketing, product, and compliance stakeholders.

### Practice
- Agree on ownership across agencies and internal teams so measurement planning, QA, and release notes have clear accountability.
- Automate QA with server side tagging, dbt tests against export tables, and Slack alerts when payloads drift.
- Treat documentation as a product with measurement diagrams, consent implications, and rollback plans for every release.

### Takeaways
- Ownership and automation prevent launch day outages and protect revenue reporting.
- Transparent playbooks give marketers confidence to move fast without inviting regulatory or reputational risk.
