    <p class="opacity-90">Etterby Analytics collects personal data only when you submit the contact form or email <a class="underline" href="mailto:hello@etterby.com">hello@etterby.com</a>. Typical fields include your name, work email, company, and project context.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">The information is used exclusively to respond to your enquiry, qualify the engagement, and maintain a record of conversations. Data is stored securely in email and CRM tooling with access limited to James Pearson.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. If we agree to collaborate using shared systems (e.g. Slack, project management, analytics platforms) we will use your company-provided access controls.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">You can request updates or deletion of your information at any time by emailing <a class="underline" href="mailto:hello@etterby.com">hello@etterby.com</a>. This policy will evolve as the services and tooling change.</p>
