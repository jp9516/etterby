    <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="opacity-90">Etterby Analytics collects personal data only when you submit the contact form or email <a class="underline" href="mailto:hello@etterby.com">hello@etterby.com</a>. Typical fields include your name, work email, company, and project context.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">The information is used exclusively to respond to your enquiry, qualify the engagement, and maintain a record of conversations. Data is stored securely in email and CRM tooling with access limited to the Etterby Analytics leadership team.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">Etterby Analytics does not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. If collaboration requires shared systems (e.g. Slack, project management, analytics platforms) the consultancy will use your company provided access controls.</p>
    <p class="opacity-90">You can request updates or deletion of your information at any time by emailing <a class="underline" href="mailto:hello@etterby.com">hello@etterby.com</a>. This policy will evolve as the services and tooling change.</p>
